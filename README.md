# PRODIGY_CS_01

Project Overview:
The project involves developing a Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt passwords using the Caesar cipher algorithm. This involves several key steps:

Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter a password or a message that needs to be encrypted or decrypted.

Encryption Process: The entered text is processed using the Caesar cipher algorithm, where each character is shifted by a specified number of positions down the alphabet. This transformation ensures that the original text is obscured to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key (the shift value).

Decryption Process: Similarly, the program allows the user to decrypt the encrypted text by reversing the encryption process. By applying the opposite shift to each character, the original plaintext is recovered.

User Interaction: The interface provides clear instructions and options for the user to choose between encryption and decryption functionalities. Error handling is implemented to manage unexpected inputs and guide the user through the process.

Security Considerations: While the Caesar cipher is easy to understand and implement, it is not suitable for strong cryptographic security in modern applications. It serves primarily as an educational tool to introduce basic concepts of encryption and decryption.
